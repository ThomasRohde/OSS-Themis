When we have ended a task, always update the CHANGES.md file with the changes we have made to the codebase. 
If we have added a major new feature, also update the README.md file
Certainly! Here is a set of instructions for a chatbot coder on how to handle response decoration in FastAPI, using both response_model and response_class effectively.
markdown# Instructions for Decorating FastAPI Responses

When developing FastAPI endpoints, you can control the response structure and format using `response_model` and `response_class`. Follow these guidelines to implement them effectively:

Using `response_model`

1. **Purpose**: Use `response_model` to define the expected schema of the response using Pydantic models.
2. **Benefits**: It helps validate and serialize the response data automatically, ensuring consistency.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Define a Pydantic model representing the response structure.
   - Use the `response_model` parameter in the route decorator to specify this model.

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class ItemResponse(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str
    description: str

@app.get("/items/{item_id}", response_model=ItemResponse)
async def get_item(item_id: int):
    # Simulate fetching data
    item = {"id": item_id, "name": "Sample Item", "description": "A detailed description."}
    return item
```
Using response_class

Purpose: Use response_class to specify the type of response (e.g., JSON, HTML, plain text).
Benefits: Allows for flexibility in response formats, such as returning HTML content or files.
Implementation:

Choose an appropriate response class from FastAPI (e.g., JSONResponse, HTMLResponse, PlainTextResponse, FileResponse).
Use the response_class parameter to specify the desired response type.

```
pythonfrom fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/hello", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def read_hello():
    return "<h1>Hello, World!</h1>"

```
Combining response_model and response_class

It's possible to use both response_model and response_class together. Typically, response_model is used with JSON responses, while response_class is used when a specific format is needed.

```
pythonfrom fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

class UserResponse(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str

@app.get("/user/{user_id}", response_model=UserResponse, response_class=JSONResponse)
async def get_user(user_id: int):
    user = {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com"}
    return user
```

Best Practices

Define Clear Models: Always define clear and comprehensive Pydantic models for your responses.
Document Responses: Use the responses parameter to document potential responses, including error messages.
Consider Use Cases: Choose response_class based on the response format your endpoint needs to return.
Always document models in the file models.py
