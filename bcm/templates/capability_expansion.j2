Added GenAI created suggested alternative descriptions of domains, both long and short versions

See sheet 'Capabilities'.

Generated manually using DanskeGPT and this prompt applied to all leaf domains (and context files with full EDM dump and background on capability modeling):

You have been provided with a comprehensive high-level capability map for a financial services organization, including descriptions of each capability area. Using this context, focus on **{{Domain}}** and perform the following tasks:

1. **Decomposition into Sub-Capabilities:**
   
    Break down the selected high-level capability into a clear and logically structured set of sub-capabilities. Each sub-capability should be as granular and actionable as possible, reflecting distinct business functions, processes, or activities that can be mapped to real-world workflows.
   
2. **Definitions and Boundaries:**
   
    For each sub-capability, provide a concise and standardized definition. Clearly articulate its scope, boundaries, and the unique business value it delivers. Ensure the definitions differentiate each sub-capability from others within the same high-level capability domain.
   
3. **Inputs, Outputs, and Stakeholders:**
   
    Identify the key inputs (e.g., data types, triggers, resources) and outputs (e.g., reports, decisions, services) associated with each sub-capability. Include the main internal stakeholders (roles, departments, teams) and any external parties (customers, partners, regulators) involved.
   
4. **Enabling Technologies and Tools:**
   
    Suggest relevant technologies, applications, or architectural components (e.g., CRM systems, data analytics platforms, workflow automation tools, integration layers, security frameworks) that could enable or support the execution of each sub-capability.
   
5. **Alignment with Industry Standards and Frameworks:**
   
    Where applicable, map each sub-capability to industry standards (such as BIAN service domains, TOGAF concepts, APQC process frameworks, or other relevant financial services frameworks) to provide external validation and a point of reference.
   

**Final Deliverable Format Requirements:**

- Present the final deliverable as a single table.
- Use the following columns and maintain the specified order and naming exactly:
    - **Sub-Capability Name**
    - **Definition**
    - **Key Inputs**
    - **Key Outputs**
    - **Key Stakeholders**
    - **Enabling Technologies**
    - **Industry Alignment**
- For each identified sub-capability, provide a single row.
- Use consistent formatting across all rows.

Output markdown format:

| Sub-Capability Name | Definition | Key Inputs | Key Outputs | Key Stakeholders | Enabling Technologies | Industry Alignment |
|---------------------|------------|------------|-------------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| [Name 1]            | [Text]     | [Text]     | [Text]      | [Text]           | [Text]              | [Text]            |
| [Name 2]            | [Text]     | [Text]     | [Text]      | [Text]           | [Text]              | [Text]            |
| ...                 | ...        | ...        | ...         | ...              | ...                 | ...               |

Ensure the final output follows this format exactly so that it remains consistent across multiple LLM invocations.
